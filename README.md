This repository contains my solutions for the exercises of the course of Artificial Intelligence of the National Technical University of Athens.

## Exercise 1
In the first exercise i implement an A* algorithm with variable heuristics and I visualize its fronts.

## Exercise 2
In the second exercise i create a simple movie recommender using python and prolog (prolog is used for the production of the queries).

## Exercise 3
In the third exercise i use the digits of the MNIST dataset in order to compare different classification algorithms that i implement, such as the KNN, Naive Bayes and a Perceptron.
